# Deploy an Azure Function using an ARM template

The master branch contains a generic version of the deployment template, tailored for a fictional version of a function that transmits Azure Monitor Logs to Splunk's HEC port. The Deploy to Azure button below works, but the deployed function does not.

See other branches for more specific, working examples.
